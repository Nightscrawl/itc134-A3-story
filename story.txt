Once upon a time, in the city of Ostwick, there lived a boy who liked to play with swords.

He was adept at swordplay and practiced with the other street urchins.

He's outstanding so his neighbor always stares at him while he practice.

The neighbor boy's father was a knight who had fled battle, so his entire family was forbidden from weilding any weapon. This made him jealous of the other boys in the street.
