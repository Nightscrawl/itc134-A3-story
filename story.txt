Once upon a time, in the city of Ostwick, there lived a boy who liked to play with swords.

He was adept at swordplay and practiced with the other street urchins.

He's outstanding so his neighbor always stares at him while he practice.

One day, the boy noticed his neighbor watching, so he went over to talk to him.

The neighbor boy's father was a knight who had fled battle, so his entire family was forbidden from weilding any weapon. This made him jealous of the other boys in the street.

Our boy in Ostwick was more than happy to speak with his neighbor. He explained to his neighbor that he was trained by a master swordsman  and that he wants to be the best fighter in the realm.
