Once upon a time, in the city of Ostwick, there lived a boy who liked to play with swords.

He was adept at swordplay and practiced with the other street urchins.

He's outstanding, so his neighbor always stares at him while he practice.

One day, the boy noticed his neighbor watching, so he went over to talk to him.

The neighbor boy's father was a knight who had fled battle, so his entire family was forbidden from weilding any weapon. This made him jealous of the other boys in the street.

Our boy in Ostwick was more than happy to speak with his neighbor. 

He explained to his neighbor that he was trained by a master swordsman and that he wants to be the best fighter in the realm.

The neighbor told him a tournament will be held in Brieland, and the winner will be given a knight's sword. 

He's really interested in it, but he's concerned with attending since Brieland is the rival city.

Seeing an opportunity, the neighbor boy offered to go with him.

In agreement to keep secret their home city so that they would not be barred attendance, the two boys of Ostwick began their journey south the next morning.

As they continue their journey, they stumble upon a demon with seven heads.

The demon asked where they are going. 

Unlike the ohter people who ran away from it right away, they calmly answered.
